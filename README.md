# ConnectionManager

This library wraps WiFiManager on ESP8266 and simplifies the handling of custom parameters. Parameters are defined by an ID and automatically added to the WiFiManager portal. After connecting the parameters are written to SPIFFS where they can be accessed on a subsequent reboot.

This library is incomplete.
